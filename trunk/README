APIBASO - by Steffen Moeller, David Ramrath and Juliane Jaepel

This projects aims at determining motifs in the sequence
of transmembrane proteins of epithelia for the sorting
to the apical or basolateral sides of the plasma membrane.

This directory contains all information required
to redo our investigations with two notable exceptions:
	* the tool SPEXS for the pattern finding
	* the tool HMMTOP for the prediction of
	  transmembrane regions
should be requested from the respective developers
Jaak Vilo and I. Tusnady.

Folder	Descriptions
--------------------

01_literature_protein_data

	XML file with a description of
	transmembrane proteins that are differentially
	transported.

02_derived_protein_subsequences

	From the above XML file the accession numbers are
	automatically selected and corresponding sequences
	retrieved from the Internet.
	HMMTOP performs the transmembrane annotation upon
	a script selects the loci of interest.

	This folder is prepared automatically and shared via
	the source code repository.

03_comparisons

	Results of pattern search with SPEXS

04_distributions

	Evaluation of patterns.

Makefile

	Workflow management, start with "make".

default.charclass
spexs.charclass

	Parameters for SPEXS

src

	Scripts controlled by the Makefile to prepare the k-Nearest-Neighour
	classifier on a (possibly changed)_XML file. The cross-validation had
	a couple of scripts that went temporarily missing.
