apibaso - scripts
-----------------

The following scripts are executed for the analysis of the XML document to prepare
the initial predictor that was based on a k-Nearest-Neighbour classification. Some
bits of David's work to prepare the files for the cross-validation may still be missing
and shall be updated over the next days.


apibaso_filter.pl	- UniProt IDs are read from the XML file and
			  with the help of BioPerl, the respective
			  entries are read from the public database.

hmmtop2sequences.pl	- using the topology predition to substract
			  subsequences on which the pattern search
			  shall be performed.

spexsFilter.pl

patterndistribution.pl  - The patterns SPEXS comes up with are run
			  against the sequences to prepare a
			  sequence x pattern
			  matrix.

evaluate_pattern.pl

selection_in_R.R	- no longer used.

knn_script.R		- cross-evaluation of patterns
